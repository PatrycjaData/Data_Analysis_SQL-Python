**Project name: **Number of cities per country

**Data source: **Sample database from SQL course

**Main Goal: ** Present the number of cities for each country

**Description:** This project analyzes how many cities exist in each
country using data from a fictional SQL database. The country table is
insufficient to store all of the informtion I need. My query required
data from two tables- country table and city table. What is more, I have
used aggregate function- Count to counts the number of cities. Inner
Join allows me to select data from two tables and country_id is the
common field in both of them.Then I used Group By in my code to take
duplicate values and collect them together. At the end of my code Having
clause allows me to filter the resaults. Thanks of this, I am able to
see total number of cities for each conutry.

**SQL clauses used in the code: **Select, Count, Inner Join , Group By,
Having

**Dashboard: **Please find the final results visualized using the bar
chart created in the Python - jupyter notebook.
